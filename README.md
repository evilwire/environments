Golang (1.5+) package for marshalling objects from environment variable values.
There are many like packages. The one that inspires this API the most is
the `json` package. The idea is that configuration objects are stored
as environment variables, especially when running as a containerised
application.

### How to use this library

```golang

// import stuff and then do things to those imported stuff


```
